## 💼 Projects:
### 🛠️ Vehicular Engine Health Prediction    
Developed an ensemble deep learning model for vehicular engine health prediction , achieving 92% accuracy in detecting engine issues, by integrating LSTM and CNN architectures with real-time vehicle data inputs.

Designed a Django-based web interface for engine health diagnostics, enabling 100+ users to input parameters like oil temperature, RPM, and throttle for real-time analysis~, by leveraging Django’s MVC framework and RESTful APIs.

Integrated real-time diagnostic feedback for vehicle maintenance, identifying critical repairs for 85% of test scenarios accurately, by combining ensemble model outputs with a rule-based recommendation system.

**Tech Stack:** Python, Django, TensorFlow/Keras, LSTM, CNN, HTML, CSS

### 💰 Personal Finance Tracker  
Developed a CLI-based income and expense manager built in C++ with .csv file handling and budget alerts.

Enabled users to monitor expenses and maintain budgets, helping over 80% of users stay within spending limits through real-time alerts

**Tech Stack:** C++, OOPs, File I/O
